<h1 align="center">
Coordination Complex Database
</h1>

<br>


Code for a streamlit page created for users wishing to navigate databases tmqm, tmQmg and tmQmg-L more easily.

## üî• Usage

> Provides the metal, molar mass, stoechiometry, number of electrons, charge and ligands of over 60 000 coordination complexes ! 
> Also gives over 30 000 ligands' SMILES, stoechiometry, charge, number of atoms and complexes they can be found in !
> All complexes and ligands are shown in 3D with the help of py3Dmol.


## üë©‚Äçüíª Installation

Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n ccdata python=3.10 
```

```
conda activate ccdata
```

If you need jupyter lab, install it 

```
(ccdata) $ pip install jupyterlab
```

## Pre-required modules

For this project to work, the following extensions must be downloaded:
  - streamlit
  - rdkit
  - py3Dmol
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - stmol
  - matplotlib


## üõ†Ô∏è Development installation

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:pschwllr/ch200`.

```
git init

git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:pschwllr/ch200.git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(ch200) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### Run tests and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```

### Generate coverage badge

Works after running `tox`

```
(conda_env) $ pip install "genbadge[coverage]"
(conda_env) $ genbadge coverage -i coverage.xml
```
